## Quasar and Pulsar

Pulsar is a Clojure API to [Quasar]. Many of the concepts explained below are actually implemented in Quasar.

## Fibers {#fibers}

Fibers are lightweight threads. They provide functionality similar to threads, and a similar API, but they're not managed by the OS. They are lightweight (an idle fiber occupies ~400 bytes of RAM), and you can have millions of them in an application. If you are familiar with Go, fibers are like goroutines. Fibers in Pulsar (well, Quasar, actually) are scheduled by one or more [ForkJoinPool](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html)s.
