/**
 * A general helper class that transforms asynchronous requests to synchronous (fiber-blocking) calls.
 *
 * ### Usage example:
 *
 * Assume that operation `Foo.asyncOp(FooCompletion callback)` is an asynchronous operation, where `Completion` is defined as:
 *
 * ```java
 * interface FooCompletion {
 *    void success(String result);
 *    void failure(FooException exception);
 * }
 * ```
 * We then define the following subclass:
 *
 * ```java
 * class FooAsync extends FiberAsync<String, Void, FooException> implements FooCompletion {
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     public void success(String result) {
 *         asyncCompleted(result);
 *     }
 *
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     public void failure(FooException exception) {
 *         asyncFailed(exception);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Then, to turn the operation into a fiber-blocking one, we can define:
 *
 * ```java
 * String op() {
 *     return new FooAsync() {
 *         protected Void requestAsync() {
 *             Foo.asyncOp(this);
 *         }
 *     }.run();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param <V> The value returned by the async request
 * @param <A> The type of the (optional) attachment object associated with this `FiberAsyc`.
 * @param <E> An exception class that could be thrown by the async request
 *
