# Quasar [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/puniverse/quasar.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/puniverse/quasar) <br/>Lightweight threads and actors for the JVM


**NOTE: This is alpha software**

## Getting started

In Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.paralleluniverse</groupId>
    <artifactId>quasar-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

For clustering support add:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.paralleluniverse</groupId>
    <artifactId>quasar-galaxy</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, build from sources by running:

```
./gradlew
```

## Usage

Currently, there isnâ€™t much in the way of documentation (coming soon!).
In the meantime, you can study the examples [here](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar/tree/master/quasar-core/src/test/java/co/paralleluniverse/actors).

You can also read the introductory [blog post](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/post/49445260575/quasar-pulsar).

When running code that uses Quasar, the instrumentation agent must be run by adding this to the `java` command line:

```
-javaagent:path-to-quasar-jar.jar
```

## Running Distributed Examples

There are a few examples for distributed actors in the [example package](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar/tree/master/quasar-galaxy/src/main/java/co/paralleluniverse/galaxy/example).
You can run them after downloading the source. In order to run the ping pong example, start the Pong actor by:
```
./gradlew :quasar-galaxy:run -PmainClass=co.paralleluniverse.galaxy.example.pingpong.Pong
```
Start the Ping actor in different terminal by:
```
./gradlew :quasar-galaxy:run -PmainClass=co.paralleluniverse.galaxy.example.pingpong.Ping
```
In order to run the actors in different computer change the following lines in the build.gradle file to apropriate network configuration:
```
        systemProperty "jgroups.bind_addr", "127.0.0.1"
        systemProperty "galaxy.multicast.address", "225.0.0.1"
```
In a similar way you can run the other examples in co.paralleluniverse.galaxy.example.simpleGenEvent and co.paralleluniverse.galaxy.example.simpleGenServer packages.
