# Quasar: lightweight threads and actors for the JVM.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/puniverse/quasar.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/puniverse/quasar)

**NOTE: This is alpha software**

## Getting started

In Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.paralleluniverse</groupId>
    <artifactId>quasar</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, build from sources by running:

```
./gradlew
```

## Usage

Currently, there isnâ€™t much in the way of documentation (coming soon!).
In the meantime, you can study the examples [here](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar/tree/master/src/test/java/co/paralleluniverse/actors).

You can also read the introductory [blog post](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/post/49445260575/quasar-pulsar).

When running code that uses Quasar, the instrumentation agent must be run by adding this to the `java` command line:

```
-javaagent:path-to-quasar-jar.jar
```
