# Quasar [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/puniverse/quasar.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/puniverse/quasar) [![Dependency Status](http://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/525be659632bac578f002552/badge.png)](http://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/525be659632bac578f002552)<br/>Lightweight threads and actors for the JVM


## Getting started

In Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.paralleluniverse</groupId>
    <artifactId>quasar-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```
To use actors, add

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.paralleluniverse</groupId>
    <artifactId>quasar-actors</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

For clustering support add:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.paralleluniverse</groupId>
    <artifactId>quasar-galaxy</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, build from sources by running:

```
./gradlew
```

## Usage

The documentation for Qusar can be found [here](http://puniverse.github.io/quasar/). It is almost incomplete, and we're working on improving it.

You can also study the examples [here](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar/tree/master/quasar-actors/src/test/java/co/paralleluniverse/actors).

You can also read the introductory [blog post](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/post/49445260575/quasar-pulsar).

When running code that uses Quasar, the instrumentation agent must be run by adding this to the `java` command line:

```
-javaagent:path-to-quasar-jar.jar
```
